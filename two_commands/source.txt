In realms where shadows dance and sway,
There strides a man named John, they say.
With eyes that pierce the darkest night,
And tales of vengeance, burning bright.

Upon his brow, a silent vow,
A lone wolf 'neath the moon's soft glow.
Yet in his silence, a tempest roars,
Defying fate, he breaks down doors.

In John's heart, a void so deep,
Where memories and nightmares creep.
Through loss and pain, he walks the line,
A solitary figure, marked by time.

Through city streets and neon haze,
He hunts his prey in endless ways.
Each bullet fired, each foe laid low,
A symphony of justice's blow.

In John's hands, the weapons gleam,
Tools of justice, in moonlight's beam.
With deadly grace, he takes his stand,
A reaper's scythe in his command.

And when the final curtain falls,
And silence echoes through the halls,
John Wick stands, his mission done,
A legend born of fire and gun.

So here's to John, the Boogeyman,
A tale of vengeance, without end.
In every shadow, his story's sung,
A vigilante's ballad, forever young.
